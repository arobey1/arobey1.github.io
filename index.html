              I'm a Ph.D. student in the 
              <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/">Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering</a> 
              at the 
              <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>
              , where I am affilliated with the
              <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">GRASP Lab</a>
              and the
              <a href="https://warrencenter.upenn.edu/">Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences</a>.
              I'm fortunate to be co-advised by 
              <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hassani/">Hamed Hassani</a>
              and 
              <a href="https://www.georgejpappas.org/">George J. Pappas</a>.
              Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at 
              <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>, 
              where I double-majored in Engineering and Mathematics.

      <!-- Research interests blurb -->
      <p><strong>Research interests: </strong> I'm interested in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of robust learning.  
      In particular, my recent work has focused on making modern tools from deep learning robust 
      to semantic changes and distributional shifts in data. Over the course of my Ph.D., 
      this topic has allowed me to study ideas from a wide variety of different
      fields, including convex optimization, control theory, generative modeling, and high-dimensional 
      statistics.</p>
