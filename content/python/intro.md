Psst!  Hey you.  Yes you!  You look like you're ready to learn Python.  And yes, you're right, I can't see you.  But I know you wouldn't be here if you weren't ready to go.  So let's do this!

**What is Python?** Python is a programming language that has become ubiquitous in fields such as data science and machine learning.  The syntax is relatively simple, and with the right guidance, it's easy to get started!

**My philosophy.**  I don't know about you, but I *despise* it when so-called "introductory" books are long, technical, and filled with jargon, minutiae, and unlikely edge cases.  You'll find that many of the Python books and resources out there are written to leave no one in any doubt that the author is an expert on the topic.  This is frustrating, because when it comes to Python, the basics are accessible to almost anyone who has worked with computers before.  And so in this set of notes, you're going to see no more or less than you need to know to get started.

Without further adieu, let's get right into it.

**Getting started.**  In this set of notes, we're going to cover the following topics.  

1. [Interacting with Python]({{< ref "/python/interacting_with_python.md" >}} "Interacting with Python")
2. [Variables, data types, and comparison]({{< ref "/python/variables_data_types.md" >}} "Variables")
3. [Mathematical operations]({{< ref "/python/math_operations.md" >}} "Math Operations")

(More lessons are on the way!)

Once you've studied these lessons, you'll be well on your way toward creating your own Python projects.  Along the way, there will be plenty of exercises -- both easy and challenging -- which will help to solidify your understanding.
