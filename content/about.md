I'm interested in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of robust learning.  
In particular, my recent work has focused on making modern tools from deep learning robust 
to semantic changes and distributional shifts in data. Over the course of my Ph.D., 
this topic has allowed me to study ideas from a variety of different
fields, including convex optimization, control theory, generative modeling, and high-dimensional 
statistics.
